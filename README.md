# Water Potability Prediction Project

## 📘 Overview
This project is designed to predict water potability using various machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and multiple algorithms to compare performance. Additionally, an R Shiny app is built to visualize predictions and interact with the model.

## ⚡ Models Implemented
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest (with saved model `best_rf_model.rds`)

## 🛠️ App Usage
The app is built using R Shiny. You can run it with:

```bash
Rscript app.R
```

Make sure R and the necessary libraries are installed.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aum-kolekar/Water_Potability.git
```
2. Install required Python and R libraries.
3. Run individual model scripts or launch the app for live predictions.
